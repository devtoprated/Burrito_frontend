# React Vite Application with Docker

This project is a React application built with Vite and containerized using Docker. The provided Dockerfile sets up a multi-stage build to compile the React app and serve it with Nginx.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Make sure Docker is installed on your machine. You can download it from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
- **Node.js and npm**: Required for local development. Install them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Project Structure

- **Dockerfile**: Contains instructions to build and serve the React application.
- **package.json**: Defines project dependencies and scripts.
- **vite.config.js**: Configuration for Vite.
- **src/**: Contains the source files for the React application.
- **public/**: Static assets that are publicly accessible.

## Vite Configuration

Ensure that your Vite configuration file, `vite.config.js`, is set up correctly. Here's an example configuration:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    port: 3000,  // Configure the port for the Vite development server
  },
});



# Explanation of Additions:

1. **Vite Configuration**: Instructions for setting up Vite, including the `vite.config.js` example and port configuration for development.
2. **Development Server**: Commands to start the Vite development server and where to access it.
3. **Accessing the Application**: Specifies how to access the app when running in Docker.

This README should provide clear instructions for both local development and running the application in a Docker container. Adjust the information based on your specific project needs and configurations.
